    "After an intense week of dedication and exploration, I have successfully built and launched my portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, hosted through GitHub Pages. üåê\n",
    "\n",
    "This has been an incredibly rewarding journey. Previously, I had created a portfolio website through my UI/UX design skills using drag and drop tools in Framer. While it was sleek and flexible with its CMS features, I soon realized the limitations‚Äîmainly high costs for a custom domain and hosting, as well as restricted flexibility in design and functionality. \n",

    "\n",
    "So, I decided to take the challenge head-on. For seven days straight, I spent over 18 hours a day diving into coding‚Äîexperimenting, failing, learning, and rebuilding. With the help of AI (hashtag#vibe_coding) and continuous practice, I was able to translate my ideas into a fully functional, self-coded website.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I learned during this process is that coding isn‚Äôt just about syntax or rules today‚Äîit‚Äôs about vibing with the code, understanding its logic, and feeling connected to what you‚Äôre creating. Once you catch that rhythm, it becomes exciting.\n",
